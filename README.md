# ee461-frontend-fundamentals
This is a minimal repo containing example code for a lecture given in the Fall 2022 semester of UT Austin EE461L, Software Engineering & Design. 

This code demonstrates basic web development principles: HTML for layout, CSS for design, and JavaScript for some simple event bindings. A PDF of my lecture slides are also included in this repo for your convenience.
